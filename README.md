# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
  The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset consists mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars and there were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle         performance such as  vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance collected for each vehicle. Using the knowledge of R, 
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis and write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
